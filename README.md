The edit-videos-using-text feature handles existing video content uniquely. Upload a video, and Pictory automatically transcribes it. You can then edit the text transcript to alter the video itself—delete sentences from the transcript, and those sections disappear from the video. This makes creating concise highlight reels ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes incredibly simple.

Pictory's strength lies in repurposing long-form content for multiple platforms. A single blog post becomes an Instagram Reel, YouTube Short, TikTok video, and LinkedIn post in minutes. Marketing teams use this to maximize the ROI of every piece of content they create.
